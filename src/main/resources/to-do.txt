in-class project that uses interfaces and multiple menu UIs to reference - https://github.com/topherbc/Java-Academy-Fall-25/tree/main/week-07/class/day-1

TO-DO:

* WORKING HERE * finish working on order logic for the PizzaOrder | see if I can pass it from cart
to a receipt that will be printed out
* need to add logic to let the user add multiple toppings to the pizza
* need to add option to allow the user to skip adding toppings to their pizza
* need to add option for the pizza to have stuffed crust
* need to find a better way to have the addons added into the order

add a drink, breadsticks, checkout, or cancel the order
